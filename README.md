# Covid-19 Circular Case Rate in Southeast Asian Countries in 2020

by Gilbert Agus Trianto,

## Description

### Objective

How high was the spread of covid cases in this Southeast Asian Country during 2020 based on cases per case date.
The cases of Covid-19 that you want to know include, starting from confirmed cases of Covid, deaths from Covid, the recovery rate from Covid, the number of Covid patients who are still actively experiencing Covid.

### Problem Statement

1. Covid-19 hit many countries in the world, inseparable from Southeast Asia which also experienced cases of covid-19 and even had a high death rate due to covid-19. In this analysis, analysts try to analyze countries in Southeast Asia in the 2020 period to obtain data that can be processed for further research.
2. The analysis can be used as a lesson for other countries regarding cases of handling Covid-19 in the future. Learning from the high recovery rate or from the low number of Covid-19 cases that have occurred can be useful learning materials.
3. Data:
     - Covid confirmation is a numerical value that continues to increase based on each incident per day.
     - Death due to covid is a numerical value that is continuously increasing based on each incident per day.
     - Recovery from covid is a numerical value that continues to increase based on each incident per day.
     - Covid patients who are active covid is a numeric value that changes according to the events per day.
    
    All of data is cumulative data in every country, and changes in every date per case.
4. Results from the analysis is statistik data from every different case in every country.


## Conclusion, Assumptions, Overall Analysis

Conclusion:
- Every Southeast Asian country that experiences Covid-19 experiences a significant increase every year, for example Indonesia.The greater the country, the higher the covid rate.
- Covid confirmation rates that are always increasing proportional to the increasing mortality rate and also a slight difference between COVID confirmation and death.
- The available data can be used well to be useful as a review of COVID handling.

Assumption:
- Indonesia gets a high covid number due to a large area of country, while Timor-Leste gets a low Covid number due to a small country.
- Singapore becomes a country that experiences covid which results in death which is proportional to the confirmation of patients with Covid, this is displayed from the visual results of the COVID comparison graph.

Overall analysis

Covid-19 in Southeast Asia has increased every month in 2020. Covid case confirmation rates and COVID mortality rates continue to increase.Each country has its own countermeasures, with the results of this analysis in order to help in adding learning data to the Covid-19 that occurred in Southeast Asia.
Each country can learn from countries that experience more mortality rates compared to the Covid confirmation rate, or even a country that experiences a large covid healing rate compared to the mortality rate due to Covid.
